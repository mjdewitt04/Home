    <p style="color: black; font-size: 48px;">This piece is called "The Last Uchiha" and was inspired by an anime I have watched called Naruto. The medium of this piece is Photoshop and the images I used were found on the web. This piece is near and dear to me because this was the first piece of mine that got displayed in an art exhibit. This piece was up for about a month at San Joaquin Delta's Student Art Exhibit. It was an unreal experience for me as an artist and has pushed me to become better and better at my craft. </p>
